I like the magazine for nostalgia reasons and they were the first to point out a problem of the campaign that I did not see raised before ninjahund completed his campaign. They even put a heavier emphasis on it, saying the new campaign mechanic is not only not really a race only but more importantly dismantles itself with safety mechanics. I translated the important parts myself – sorry for the bad English, second language and all. Randomness instead of suspense: If we start the ritual Рецепты (крафтинг) Рецепты преобразования вещей в Terraria не являются секретом, и как только у нас оказываются все необходимые ингредиенты – появляется возможность создать соответствующий.

Hi all, been playing for about a month and I have yet to see a clear answer about this for the current patch. Does each blade have its own hit timer, or does the buff hit on increments as a whole? i.e. with 10 stacks would I be doing 3.33 hits per second (including tick speed increase from stacks) or 33.3 per second (each blade hitting 3.33/sec).

I personally think Vortex is great idea, having objective based game in total war is fun and fresh experience, BUT it needs huge changes to be great. I have the list of issues/suggestion, lets talk about them, or maybe you can think of some more and lets give CA (or maybe modders) ideas how to improve it. Chaos / Skaven armies and spawning "randomly" in the middle of your territory, making your prepared defences useless. 1. Etherwind 0:00 2. Veil of Our Misconceptions 4:55 3. Amer by Amer 16:21 4. Infinite Divisibility 25:51 5. Andyl. I do not like, to say the least, how an intervention army pops up in the middle of my lands, and races to a city and razes it. All on the same turn, the computers turn, without the slightest thing I can do about it. Intervention should be something you can do when someone starts the ritual. And the army should start at your capital and then begin marching towards the target. The chaos are also not well done (to be polite). You can't know what route they take. They raze everything 
This album was born on an impulse. There were no lingering thoughts of its appearance. It emerged as a result of only one walk, a result of an impression Just want to know what everybody thinks about the vortex mechanic. So far I don't particularly like it. Gathering ritual resources isn't very exciting, and triggering the rituals feels like a chore: those pesky stacks will spawn somewhere and your main concern is that your minor cities don't get razed. Also you're mostly confronted with the decision to either sit back and defend your ritual sites or instead just conquer some more lands while hoarding the ritual resource. Which I tend to do since. Twin opposing Vortices. Notice how the North and South Polar Electric Vortices meet head on. Anything which can not become its opposite mate as it passes through the Center, must be cast off at the equator, creating an East-West pole of magnetic expansion, otherwise known as the ecliptic. Hey I wanted to talk about the whole vortex mechanic and how it is balanced or rather imbalanced. In my opinion a lot of the stuff is rather imbalanced and annoying. All my observations are based on a very hard campaign I am not sure if it feels better on other difficulties. 1. The randomly spawning chaos/skaven doomstacks are annoying because most of the time they spawn somewhere in the middle of your land not even close to any of the ritual sites and just start razing your stuff. Длинная дорога познания усеяна препятствиями и предоставляет множество заманчивых обходных путей, которые выглядят вполне надёжно, однако, в конечном счёте. 
Is it disabled? Do you pool resources if you're different races? Do you pool resources if you're the same race? Are you against each other if you're different races? Are you against each other if you're Steam Workshop: Total War: WARHAMMER II. This mod remove the vortex mechanic from the campaign. It stops the AI from performing vortex rituals. You can still perform them though. I tested it by waiting a 100 turns and not a single AI perfo. Some current issues with screenshots: 1) The AI gains fragments overtime, at an identical rate, resulting campaigns like this (https://i.imgur.com/1o4XIy6.png), where the rituals tick at the exact same rates (https://i.imgur.com/Mxdo17U.jpg). 2) The AI will ALWAYS trigger a ritual, whether or not it is ready (https://i.imgur.com/dmSfHOx.jpg) for the incoming waves of hostility (https://i.imgur.com/KIS6Ep3.jpg). 3) Intervention forces: The composition of the forces can look scary Слушайте онлайн лучшие песни Vortex Mechanic.

Hi, I'm interested in knowing if taking Avatar of Fire (from Xoph's Blood ) will affect Vortex's ability to slow and/or chill enemies.

Download our mobile Hello, I am in the process of building a Pathfinder-Scold's Bridle-Zerphi-Blade Vortex build and I was wondering exactly how two or more different iterations of Blade Vortex interact when stacked. Previously each Blade Vortex cast was a separate entity that dealt damage independent of other casts, but with the 2.5 change if I say cast: Level 1 Blade Vortex (7-10 DMG) and then a Level 2 Blade Vortex (8-12 DMG) will the resulting spell deal 15-22 DMG (sum), 7.5-11 DMG (average), or does it alterna.

Do multiple gem setups use the same stack and compliment each others, do they use different damage/aoe values, do they use the smae hitcounter, etc? Anyone care to explain how it works after the poison fix please.

Honestly it's hard to justify casting ice nova/vortex when you can just cast frost bolt twice instead. There's no reason to waste sockets on having a pre-casted frostbolt, especially since spell echo literally does nothing on it. I first thought that the nova would ripple through all of the frost bolts, but while that would be op, I think the current mechanics are really weak and my crazy excitement for this skill was instead replaced with the acrid taste of disappointment. I guess The long road of learning is strewn with obstacles and provides many enticing detours that seem quite reliable, however, eventually 
1. When using Hypothermia will Vortex's cold DoT chill alone (so for example if you were a 100% cold to fire build) trigger the more damage for the 2nd Vortex? 2. Related to 1. Does Hypothermia increase the cold DoT? 3. Does Vortex's "modifiers to spell damage affect this skills DoT" mean ignite damage will also increase with spell damage? I have lvl 89 and 90 vortex characters on this league and I'm still at the experimental stage with this skill.

Hi all, I want to roll a Frostbolt + Vortex toon in Prophecy but I am slightly confused about the mechanics. The Prophecy announcement post says the following: gt Vortex is a new area spell that explodes in a burst of cold around the caster, creating an icy vortex. If used on a Frostbolt in mid-air, the Frostbolt explodes, letting the caster create vortices across the battlefield. The Vortex gem states that it has an explosion component and a DoT component, but then only lists one damage. 
«It was during a walk with my friend Nickolay. Despite the fact that it was summer, the weather was really autumnal, gloomy. We were going along the route. If I have 30 instances of blade vortex up and the spell hits twice per second, am I hitting 2 or 60 times per second? I want to know if I can sustain power charge generation for a coc vortex discharge build just through the assassin passive (10% chance to get a power charge on a non critical strike). When Vortex Mechanic forecasts the future, you might want to take notice. It would be a disservice to not write about it. It's well worth Im wondering, even though it somewhat looks like it, Blade Vortex has no built-in pierce mechanic, right? ~~It just hits 2 times per cast / spawns 2 blades per cast?~~ Would pierce (Psybient, Ambient, Downtempo, Progressive Trance) Vortex Mechanic - Constructor 24bits - 2016 (Plexus Music # PLX128), FLAC (tracks), lossless. I am extremely disappointed with the vortex campaign for co-op play as the vampire coast. It feels half cobbled together from a reduced mortal empires with some of the vortex solo play involved. The campaign goals are just super generic 10k infamy and kill the major factions to the playable races. Then add to that the Pieces of eight being non shareable unless you both participate in the battle (Which wouldn't have been a bad thing IF we were told about it in the first place).

Hello bbs community. While this whole Hell Verse quote unquote event IS, by all means, lazy and rushed, I believe we can all appreciate the fact that Klab actually went out of their way and implemented Kokuto into our game. You might be thinking this is not a big deal, a character is a character, but let me remind you, this smooth pimp daddy is the Voice of Roronoa Zoro (One Piece) and Wakka (Broken in FFX, ludicrous damage).

CA acknowledged from the beginning that they were trying to get ME into player hands sooner at the expense of polishing it for another month or two. As a result, the launch went about as you'd expect. The bug list is almost as long as Thorgrim's grudge list, Chaos is hellbent on your destruction (and only yours), and the true Everchosen, Surtha "Genghis" Ek rides for wrath and ruin once again, turning the lands of men into a smouldering wasteland long before you arrive for your ultimate showdown.
